##Requirements
*For Windows*

* Windows 7 (not tested on Vista or XP)
* 3GB RAM
* 5MB Available Hard Drive Space
* Graphics card that can support OpenGL 3.0 & GLSL v1.0 (basically any modern non-Intel GPU)

##Installation
Installation is simple: Extract the contents of the ZIP Archive into any folder. Double-click on OPHD.exe to launch the game.

##Configuration
At the moment there are very few configurable options for OutpostHD. All of it must be done via the XML configuration file (config.xml) located in the 'data' subdirectory.

Please use SANE values as there is no sanity checking. You can set the video resolution to whatever you want but if your monitor or graphics card doesn't support it don't expect things to work.

##Troubleshooting
OutpostHD is in an early state of development so there's not much to say other than make sure you have the latest graphics drivers. Head on over to [the forums](http://forum.outpost2.net) for help getting OutpostHD running if you run into trouble.

##FAQ
**Q: How do I get started?**

A: Click on the Build Structure button (underneath the System button on the lower right side of your screen). A green selection menu will pop up at the top left of your screen with one option, "SEED Lander". Click on "SEED Lander". Your mouse pointer will change into a diamond shape (Insert Pointer). Click anywhere you think is a suitable landing site.

Keep in mind that the SEED Lander can't be placed within 3 tiles of any of the edges of the map and must have all tiles surrounding it be free of obstructions like Mine's and Impassable Terrain.
